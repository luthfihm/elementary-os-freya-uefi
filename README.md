# Install Elementary OS using UEFI
==================================

*Disclaimer: I provide no warranties. Backup and safely store your data/settings. This document was created from my
experience, but your experience might differ.*

*The Elementary OS team prefers not to abbreviate the name of the operating system to "eos". I found this out after
creating these steps, and to minimize errors in my documentation I will continue to use the abbreviation, but remember
this is not desired by the Elementary OS team.*
